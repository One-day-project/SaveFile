And baby just stay
with me and here today
Our lives could fade
Fade and walk away
with you by my side
i feeling like i can fly
with you tonight
if you want to stay

And baby i can say
I love you ever day
feeling like a flame
with you i here today

like a sun
Like a moon
Like a pretty little song
Only you, only you

And baby just stay
with me and here today
our lives could fade
fade and walk away
with you by my side
i feeling like i can fly
with you tonight
if you want to stay

And you and i could die
for love and some little time
you a pretty light
and you my safetly time

And i want you tonight
Hug you every time
fell in love too deep
like a little breath to feek

And i dont want to done
till i can be feel to long
till you here stay with me
see the sea and feeling peace

And baby just stay
with me and here today
our lives could fade
fade and walk away
with you by my side
i feeling like i can fly
with you tonight
if you want to stay
